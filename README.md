# FastNeuralBurst
FastNeuralBurst is python package for cosmological inference with likelihood-free or Simulation-based Inference using the dispersion measure (DM) of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). The package is constructed using functions, which makes it flexible and modular for any input models. The config file contains all the parameters with a brief desccription, which acts as the input.
